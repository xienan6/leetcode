1. If a number is multiplied by ten and does not exceed n, then it should be ten times next to it.  
2. If 1 is not satisfied, it should be directly increased by one.  
3. If 2 is not satisfied, for example, 19 should be followed by 2 instead of 20, and then 19 should be divided by 10 and then added by one.  
Time complexity O(n), Space complexity O(n)
