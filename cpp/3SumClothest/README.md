You can sort the array firstly. Then traverse the array, and use two pointer from start and end. Because of sorted already, you can find all answer in O(n^2) time. Like [3Sum]((https://github.com/xienan6/leetcode/tree/master/cpp/3SumClothest/3SumClothest.cpp))
Time complexity O(n^2), Space complexity O(1)
