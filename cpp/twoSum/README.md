The easy solution is use a O(n^2) run-time complexity method. However, we can use a map or a hashmap to store numbers and reduce run-time complexity to O(nlogn) or O(n) because a hashmap or a map can find the number = target - number[0] in O(logn) or O(1).  
Time complexity O(n), Space complexity O(n)
