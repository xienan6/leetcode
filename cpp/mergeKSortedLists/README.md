Use a minimum heap or a priority queue to store first nodes in each list. Insert a new node is O(logk) and get minimum is O(1).  
You can also merge with divide dnd conquer. Time complexity is also O(nlogk). But its constant may a little bigger than the first solutions.  
Time complexity O(nlogk), Space complexity O(1)
